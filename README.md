## Fish Room
A simple chat room, but fish themed 

## How it works client side
A client fish joins the server and sends a message, then eventually the other client fish will receive that message

#### How it works server side
* Once a message is sent the server relays the message to the other client fish that are currently connected

#### How to connect
* First find the ip of the server
* Launch either fishclient or fishchatsharp
* If using fishclient it will automatically ask for a port
* If using fishchatsharp you need to go to file and then connect to server
* Then you enter the ip, port, and username
* Then it will connect and you can start chatting
